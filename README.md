# Project Name: Twitter Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Twitter data for silverspace Inc  using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Dataset
Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included directly in this repository. You can download the dataset from the following link:

[Download the dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GY_-vRTkAdx7i7Sp4ZbCfO2yiG-iSNRJ?usp=sharing)

After downloading the dataset, place it in the root directory of this project and name it `correct_twitter_201904.tsv`.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-data-analysis.git




   
### 3. What To Do After Uploading the Files to GitHub

Once you've uploaded your files (Jupyter notebook, dataset, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt`), you're almost done! Here's a checklist of what to do next:

#### Checklist:
1. **Review Your Files**: Make sure that the following files are in your repository:
   - `POTATO_Twitter_Analysis.ipynb`
   - `README.md`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - Any datasets or additional scripts (if relevant).

2. **Test Your Code**: Double-check that your notebook runs properly. If others are going to use your system, make sure there are no errors when running the notebook from start to finish.

3. **Share the Repository**: Once everything is uploaded and working correctly:
   - Copy the link to your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/POTATO-Twitter-Data-Analysis`).
   - Share this link via email with the assessor (or according to the task requirements).

4. **Final Verification**: Open your GitHub repository in an incognito browser window to ensure that itâ€™s public and that everything (including the notebook) is visible.

### In Summary:
1. **Files to Include**:
   - Jupyter Notebook (`POTATO_Twitter_Analysis.ipynb`)
   - `README.md`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - Dataset file (if size allows).
   
2. **How to Write `README.md`**:
   - Provide an overview, installation instructions, how to use the system, sample queries, and justification for design choices.
   
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Upload files to GitHub, verify them, and share the link with the assessor.
